# NL-Find (Natural Language Find)

An implementation of the functionality provided by Unix-style `find` command which
accepts arguments in "natural language" rather than the often-obscure standard set
of options.

This is still in the "exploratory" phase, and it is written in a language I'm just
learning ([Rust](https://rust-lang.org)), so it is a) not necessarily useful, and b)
not published to [crates.io](https://crates.io).
